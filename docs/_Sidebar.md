# KD-Code System Wiki

Welcome to the official wiki for the KD-Code System - a revolutionary circular barcode technology invented by K. D. Sithara Nimsara and J. A. Umeda Sammani.

## About KD-Code

Unlike traditional linear barcodes or QR codes, KD-Codes use a circular pattern to encode information, offering enhanced data density and scanning flexibility. This innovative system provides numerous advantages over conventional approaches.
