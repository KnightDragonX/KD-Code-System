# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a comprehensive KD-Code system with 100 advanced features including machine learning, blockchain, AR, IoT integration, and multiple platform integrations.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: Python (Flask), JavaScript (Three.js, Tailwind CSS), OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow
- Architecture: Backend services with REST API, frontend with responsive design, multiple integration modules
- Build commands: `python app.py`, `npm install`, `npm run build`
- Testing: Unit tests in test files, integration tests for services
- File structure: Organized into backend/, frontend/, integrations/, ml_models/, ar_overlay/

## Recent Actions
- Successfully implemented all 100 requested features including ML error correction, blockchain verification, AR overlay, IoT integration, and multiple platform integrations
- Created comprehensive codebase with backend services, frontend components, and integration modules
- Implemented security features including biometric authentication and quantum-resistant encryption
- Developed analytics and monitoring systems with predictive capabilities
- Completed all major components including REST API v2, GraphQL support, webhook system, and third-party integrations
